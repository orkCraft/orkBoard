"""Pick one (docs/specs/51-pick-one.md §2, decisions §64): a task of the plan may end with two to six variants of one kind
(pictures, sounds, clips or texts) instead of a change; the person picks one, with a note, or none.

    idea_pick.clean_ask(raw)                 # a plan's task `pick`: {"n", "kind", "ask", "target"}, else None
    variants, why = idea_pick.read(worktree, task)    # the task's files and manifest, checked; else ([], what is wrong, in plain words)
    pick = idea_pick.store(state_dir, slug, task, rnd, variants, by="grunt")    # the files move to the goal's state folder
    idea_pick.discard(worktree)              # the folder and the manifest leave the worktree
    idea_pick.current(state_dir, slug, task) # the pick of the task's round (pick.json), None before one
    idea_pick.answer(state_dir, slug, pick, picked="B", note="…")      # pick.json gains what the person said
    idea_pick.map_of(task)                   # {"n", "media", "round"} while the task is `picking`, else None

The task writes each variant as a file into `.orkcraft-pick/` at its worktree's root and a manifest `.orkcraft-pick.json`:
`{"variants": [{"name": "<24 characters at most>", "file": "<its name in the folder>", "why": "<one line>"}]}`. Nothing of it
is committed (as a check's findings file, realm/idea_checks.py): it is read, moved to `<state>/ideas/<goal>/picks/<task>-r<round>/`
with a `pick.json`, and the worktree is put back. A file's type is sniffed from its bytes (realm/media_sniff.py), never from its
name: that a text is Markdown is the one thing the name says. A variant is stored as `<key>.<ext>` (`a.png`), so a name the task
chose can never be a path, a dot-file or a surprise in a URL.

No face, no model. The route that serves the files is gui/media.py.
