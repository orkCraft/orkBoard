"""What a goal's party did (docs/specs/43-party-measured.md §2): each member's tasks, merged the first time and $, each checker's
ideas checked, clean, caught, left and $, from the goal's ideas' plans. A pure read: no face, no model, it writes nothing.

    party_work.work(root, state_dir, "billing")        # §2.1's object (an Ideation party's with `pitches`: realm/pitches.py `tally`)

`root` is the Board's tree (where the goal's and the ideas' pages are), `state_dir` the project's state. A goal's party is its
leader, its builders and its checkers (realm/goal_team.py). A *check task* is one whose `kind` is a checker's tag
(realm/idea_checks.py `TAGS`); the others are the work. Times and costs are the ledgers' own: a `usd` is `None` when nothing
of it was priced, never 0.
