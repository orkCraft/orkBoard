SCHEMA_TEMPLATE = """# The wiki's rules — {topic}

This folder is an LLM wiki on one topic ({about}). The librarian orc of the 🗑️ Scroll Dump keeps
it from the sources; people may write it too. Edit these rules freely — the orc follows them.

## Sections

Pages live in `pages/<section>/`, one topic per page, named in kebab-case
(`pages/{first}/some-topic.md`). Every section has an `index.md` listing its pages and a
`CLAUDE.md` with the section's own rules (agents load it when they work there).

{sections}

Add a section only when a topic fits none of these: add it here, with its index and rules.

## Hierarchy

A wiki may grow to thousands of pages; keep every map short enough to read at a glance.
When a section passes ~40 pages, split it into subfolders (`pages/modules/payments/`), each
with its own `index.md` and, when its pages need rules of their own, its own `CLAUDE.md`.
Every index lists only its own level: pages and subfolders, one line each. An agent walks
`index.md` → section index → subfolder index → page, never the whole tree.

## A page

Every page starts with front matter, then a title, then the content:

    ---
    kind: <the section's kind, e.g. {first}>
    aliases: [<other names it goes by: code names, abbreviations, old names>]
    sources: [<the source paths it is drawn from>]
    updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    owner: orc            # or human: then the orc never edits it
    ---
    # Title

    One paragraph that answers "what is this and why does it matter" — agents decide from it
    whether to read on.

The aliases and the first paragraph are what searches hit: put every name people or the code
use for the thing there. Link other pages with relative links (`[release](../how-to/release.md)`); name a thing the
same way everywhere (the glossary wins). A page nothing links to is an orphan.

## Keeping it true

- Prefer updating a page to adding one; merge duplicates.
- When sources disagree, say so on the page (`> ⚠ Conflict: …`) instead of picking a side.
- When a source is gone, keep what is still true and mark the rest `> ⚠ Stale: …`.
- Never edit a page whose owner is human (or that carries `<!-- manual -->`): write what you
  would change in `proposals.md` (page, change, source) instead.
- Never copy secrets, tokens or personal data into the wiki.
- A meeting's page (`kind: meeting`, `calendar: meet:<id>`) has a **To discuss** list under a
  `<!-- to-discuss … -->` marker: the Wiki keeps it from people's notes and people tick it off — never
  edit that list. Write the page's Background from the pages its notes link; a person's page gets a
  line for each meeting with them.

## The maps

`index.md` lists the sections, one line each, and the few pages most people need. Each
`pages/<section>/index.md` lists its pages, one line each: what the page answers. `log.md`
gets one entry per ingest, newest first: the date, the sources taken in, the pages touched.
