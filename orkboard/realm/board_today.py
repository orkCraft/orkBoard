"""Today's events (docs/specs/49-one-window.md §2.2): the event log since local midnight as the rows of the strip beside the
Board's field. A pure read of lines already read: no face, no git, no write.

    board_today.rows(lines, titles, into="dev", since=board_today.midnight(now))     # newest first, at most 40

`lines`: the log's lines (`event_log.read`), oldest first; `titles`: the Board's names for them,
`{"ideas": {slug: {"title", "short"?, "goal"}}, "goals": {slug: title}, "tasks": {slug: {task id: title}}}`; a title the Board no
longer has reads as the slug (a task's as its idea's title, else the idea's slug). `into`: the branch a merge went into
(a line that says its own wins). One row per line of these events, the rest skipped:

    task_state merged        ✓ ok     merged into <into>      (a check that found nothing, `clean`, landed nothing: no row)
    task_state failed        ✗ danger failed
    task_state dropped       ✗ muted  dropped                 (one dropped at Review has its `result_decided` row instead)
    result_decided back/fix  ↺ muted  sent back
    result_decided drop      ✗ muted  dropped
    plan_passed              ▸ ink    the work started
    idea_answered, goal_answered   ·  muted  you answered
    proposal_answered        + / · muted taken / left out
    gate_merged              ✓ ok     dev merged into main    (title dev → main; the line's own `into` and `main` win)
    idea_flagged             ⚑ ok     is in main              (title: the goal's short name; spec 50 §2.4)
    pick_asked               ! alert  Pick one                (spec 51 §2.4: a task left variants for the person to pick from)
    pick_answered            ✓ ok     Picked B                (a key); ↺ muted  New ones asked  (none of them)

A row is `{at ("HH:MM", local), mark, tone, words, title, goal, idea, task, open}`: `goal` is its idea's goal (the gate's row
has none: it belongs to every goal), `open` what a click opens, `{kind, slug, task?}`: a `result` (the code a merge or a
sent-back task made), a `task` (a failure's, a drop's), an `idea`, a `goal` (the one answered), the `gate` or a `pick` (the
task whose variants wait, or were answered).
