"""📒 The local event log (docs/design/dogfood-logs.md §3): every product event, exact, on this machine only.

    event_log.record(root, event_log.ASKED, building="pool", ork="Grunt", task="t1", text="Which port?")
    event_log.read(root, since="2026-10-14")       # the lines, oldest first
    event_log.counts(root, since="2026-10-14")     # {event: how many}
    event_log.summary(root, since=…)               # the counts the owner reads after a week (`orkcraft usage local`)

It sits beside the anonymous usage stats (core/usage.py) and is not them: whatever the person said to sharing,
these lines are written to `.orkcraft/usage/events.jsonl` in the town's folder and never leave the machine — no
proxy, no batch, no network. They may hold the town's own words (a question an ork asked, its options), because
only the person who owns the town reads them, by hand or in the analytics zip (realm/analytics.py).

A closed list of events (`EVENTS`); an unknown one is not written. A field is kept as it is when it is plain data
(a string, a number, a bool, a list of strings); a string is cut at `TEXT_MAX`. Writing never troubles the town:
a disk that refuses is ignored. Nothing is written in the demo (the caller passes no root).

No face here: a service records, a face reads (decisions §8: these counts size the way to ask after a week).
