"""The agents' roles and the task types (spec 34 §3, decisions §46): a role is a name, a model, an instruction and
how many may work at once; each task type is given one role.

    roles(state_dir)                       # the roles, the built-in two first
    save(state_dir, "Docs scribe", "warrior", 2, "Write plainly.")      # its slug
    drop(state_dir, "docs-scribe")         # its task types go back to Grunt
    kinds(state_dir)                       # {"code": "grunt", "tests": "grunt", …}
    set_kind(state_dir, "docs", "docs-scribe")
    role_for(state_dir, "docs")            # the role a task of that type runs as

One small file per role, `<state_dir>/roles/<slug>.md` (front matter `name, model, max_parallel, craft`; the body is the
instruction), so it is seen and undone by hand; the types' roles are `<state_dir>/roles/kinds.json`. **Taskmaster**
(the keeper) and **Grunt** (the default worker) exist by themselves: they can be edited, not deleted.

A role is who; the Target is how much thinking (spec 36 §3): a model is "" **By Target** (the task's own tier,
shifted by the Target; every role but the Taskmaster, and a new agent's default) or a tier (`elder · warrior ·
laborer`); the Taskmaster picks a tier only. A file that names another model (written before, or by hand) keeps it
and runs it (`hand_set`). An instruction is at most 600 characters; a longer one in its file goes to the ork cut at
its last sentence end (`instruction`, the file's whole text in `instruction_long`) until the person saves. An agent
takes its task types (`save(..., takes=[...])`); Grunt takes what no other agent takes.

A role's **craft** is what its work is (decisions §53): engineering, design, data or marketing; the page draws it as the
head of its race in orkUI (an ork, an elf, a goblin, a gnome: `RACES`), wearing its tier's gear (`head_tier`). Taskmaster
and Grunt are orks: engineering, always. A file without a craft is engineering.

    head(r, "balance")                     # {"craft": "design", "race": "elf", "tier": "elder"}: the head a role wears (a role's own `race`,
                                           # front matter, when orkUI's copy has its head at that tier: spec 68 §1.3)
    task_head(state_dir, task, "thrift")   # the head of the role a task runs (or will run) as, at the tier it runs at
    known(state_dir)                       # (roles by slug, kinds): read once, handed to many task_head calls

No face, no model.
