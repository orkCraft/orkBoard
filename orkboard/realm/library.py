"""The agents that come with Orkline (a party's members are picked from them, decisions §53): makers and checkers of each craft,
each with the kinds of work it takes (the tags the Taskmaster puts on a task), its tier, one line of what it does and
its instruction. A checker brings its `check` to a party: the party sets how deep a goal is worked (a party with an
Accessibility reviewer holds every goal that changes a screen to its check): when it applies, the line it adds to the
spec's Done when, and the task it adds to the plan, after the work (core/idea_checks.py). A `check`'s `applies` is also in the
draft's prompt, which keeps the code's words (idea); the page says it in today's.

    LIBRARY                                  # the agents, by craft
    get("ui-kit")                            # one, or None
    install(state_dir, ["product-designer"]) # a role file for each not in the project yet (realm/roles.py); kept if there

Installing makes an ordinary role of the project: its file is `<state_dir>/roles/<id>.md`, edited on Agents like any
other; installing it again never overwrites it. Grunt is the built-in one. An agent of the library takes no task type of
the project's (kinds.json stays as it was): it takes its kinds only in the teams it is in (roles.role_for).

No face, no model.
