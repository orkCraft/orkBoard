"""The person's own parties (docs/specs/43-party-measured.md §6): a goal's party saved from its screen and picked again for a goal in any
project. Kept for every project (decisions §51.1): `parties.json` beside the machine's settings
(`~/.config/orkcraft/parties.json`), written whole and atomically, mode 600, never in a repository. No face, no model.

    own_parties.list()                                   # [{"id", "name", "craft", "leader", "team", "every", "own", "saved", "uses", "preset"?}]

`own`: every member (the leader too) that is neither a library agent nor built in, as its role file says it at the save; the Taskmaster
and the Grunt are never carried. A file of another shape reads as none and is not overwritten until a save.
