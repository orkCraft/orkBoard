"""A release (docs/specs/68-release-and-route.md §3, decisions §83.5–§83.6): a goal of the type *A release*, a version and the goals
that go in. **What goes in** is the flags raised since the last release that is out, in the parties the release's party
*releases from*; the person ticks them. A release keeps its own file beside its state, `<state_dir>/ideas/<slug>/release.json`
(`{version, goals, out, at}`), and the goals that go in are never written: their route reads the releases (realm/idea_route.py).
