"""The goal types (specs 52 and 59, decisions §65.4–§65.5, §72): the kinds of goal a party's team can take on (*New logo*, *Fix a
bug*), each with its sign (orkUI's), the few lines only the person can give (its asks), whether looks matter (Refs), the lens
it opens first, a line for the leader's draft and plan, and the kinds of work it needs of the party. One catalog; a party is
offered the types its team can do, and few others: one it misses one agent for only when the leader itself does another part
of it (the agent of the library who does is offered: a free seat joins, a full band swaps).

A goal keeps its type in its state (`type`, realm/ideas.py `STATE_DEFAULT`) by the catalog's id, given once and never changed. A
type is told by its sign, never by a colour. The types' names and lines are the interface's words; `plan` keeps the code's.

No face, no model.
