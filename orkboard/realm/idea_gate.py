`git` is an `IdeaGit` (realm/idea_git.py). `merge` runs under the repository's lock. When main is an ancestor of dev,
main is fast-forwarded to dev the way a result lands (`IdeaGit._fast_forward`: a root checkout on main moves with
`merge --ff-only` and is refused with its files when they are changed, else `update-ref`). Otherwise (main moved since)
a merge commit is made in a worktree of its own, detached at main, and main is fast-forwarded to it. Whatever is
refused, main is as it was and no worktree is left behind. Nothing here moves dev.
