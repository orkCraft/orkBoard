"""What a party costs, before it starts (docs/specs/43-party-measured.md §3): about what an idea costs with a leader, its builders
and its checkers, from this project's own ideas once there are enough of them, a first guess before. A pure read of the plans and the
ledgers: no face, no model, it writes nothing.

    party_price.price(root, state_dir, settings, "architect", ["grunt", "tester", "reviewer"], every=["reviewer"])   # §3.1's object

`root` is the Board's tree (the ideas' pages), `settings` the Board's (its Target). The basis is the project's newest `BASIS` ideas
with a plan; the price is *learned* from `idea_spend.TOO_FEW` of them with priced lines. A task costs what `ideas.roles` says an
agent's task costs (its week's spend by its tasks that ended from `TOO_FEW` of them, else a task at its head's tier).
