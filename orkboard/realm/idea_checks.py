"""The checks a goal's team holds its ideas to (realm/library.py `Check`): the team sets how deep an idea is worked. Each
checker of the team asks, of every idea of the goal, whether its check applies; when it does, its line goes in the spec's
Done when and its task in the plan, after the work it checks; when it does not, the Taskmaster says why. A checker set
to `every` idea applies always.
