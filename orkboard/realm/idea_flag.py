"""A goal's flag (docs/specs/50-parties-and-goals.md §2.2, decisions §63.3): the mark a goal gets, once, when the gate takes it
into main, or when it is done where there is no gate. It is kept beside the goal's state, `<state_dir>/ideas/<slug>/flag.json`,
with what the goal took (its tally). A party's flags are its goals' flags; a party's old flag (a verdict met,
`realm/goal_flags.py`) is history and stays where it is.

    idea_flag.tally(root, state_dir, "dark-mode")                  # {"tasks", "first_time", "usd", "days"}
    idea_flag.raise_flag(root, state_dir, "dark-mode", "gate", commit)   # writes the flag once; the one it has when it has one
    idea_flag.flag_of(state_dir, "dark-mode")                      # the flag as kept, None before it is raised
    idea_flag.commits_of(state_dir, "dark-mode")                   # the commits of its merged tasks (what `idea_gate.all_in` asks main)

No face, no model, no git: the host decides *when* (gui/ideas_gate.py); this module keeps and counts. A flag is never undone.
