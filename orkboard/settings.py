The tools the operator leads and how each is paid for, and the quiet hours of their day (design:
docs/design/onboarding.md). There is one look now: `mode`, `office` and `office_days` of older
settings files still load and are ignored, and are no longer written. `look` is not a mode: it changes
only how the GUI draws (docs/design/portrait.md §3).
Orkline never stores an API key here: `billing` only says how the CLI is paid for.
