"""Save logs (the owner's notes of 19 October): an error's **Save logs** and the gear's day logs are written to the
Downloads folder, since the app's window downloads nothing a link gives it; the page then says where and shows it.

The zip is the Board's analytics zip of the shown project (`BoardLogs.pack_period`: every model call of the day with
what went in and came out, the event log, the ideas' state and plans) and beside it `about.json` (realm/diagnostics.py:
where Orkboard runs, each AI tool as it finds it), `on-screen.txt` (the words the person saved it from) and the end of
the Mac app's own log. Desktop only: a phone saves nothing on the computer (gui/board_host.py `BoardPhone`).

    logs.save {"days"?, "said"?}  → {"path", "name", "folder"}
    logs.show {"path"}            → the file shown in Finder (or the folder opened); only a zip saved here
