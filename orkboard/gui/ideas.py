"""The board's host commands (spec 29a §6): tracks and ideas from the Wiki, the keeper, the runner.

    ideas = Ideas(host)
    host.commands.update(ideas.commands())     # ideas.board, ideas.page, ideas.add, … (the phone may call them all)
    ideas.tick(now)                            # the host's clock: the keeper's batch, the runner's tick
    ideas.snapshot()                           # focus, ideas_rev, needs_you, review_count, limits, reserve: in the snapshot
    ideas.stop_all()                           # Stop all

The pages live in the Wiki joined to the board (`realm/ideas.py`), what runs on them in `.orkcraft/ideas/`. The
keeper (`core/idea_keeper.py`) reads, talks and plans in the background; the runner (`core/idea_runner.py`, spec 29a
part B) carries a passed plan's tasks to `main`. Every change bumps `ideas_rev`, so the board and the phone know to
look again.

Spec 33 adds Review: the results waiting for the person (`ideas.review_list`, `ideas.diff`), their three answers
(`ideas.merge`, `ideas.back`, `ideas.drop_task`), `ideas.stop_task`, the Agents window (`ideas.agents`), one task
with its log (`ideas.task`) and the branch results merge into (`ideas.into`).

Spec 35: an idea needs a goal and is drafted at once (or kept on `hold`); the board, Needs you, autostart
and the Board's own commands are in gui/ideas_board.py; a file to-do's file is kept beside the secrets.

Spec 49: the gate, dev → main (`ideas.gate`, `ideas.gate_merge`: gui/ideas_gate.py), today's events (`ideas.today`:
gui/ideas_recap.py) and the reserve in the snapshot.

Spec 65: a goal of an Ideation party is a pitch, judged and never built (`ideas.judge`, `ideas.pitch_send`, `ideas.pitch_again`,
`ideas.pitch_pass`: gui/ideas_pitch.py); the plan's commands refuse it.

Spec 68: a goal's route (`ideas.move` only before its work starts), a release (`ideas.release_out`, `ideas.release_candidates`, `goes_in` of
`ideas.add`) and the faces' party switch (`ideas.shown`): gui/ideas_release.py.

Spec 70: the Orkmaster's suggestion of a goal's party (`ideas.party_for`): gui/ideas_project.py; its deal is in `ideas.map`'s `project`.

Spec 71: the Orkmaster keeps the parties from colliding (`ideas.collide_answer`; a plan made or a spec changed is compared with the other parties'
open goals; a goal's `depends_on` across parties holds its start until a flag): gui/ideas_project.py, realm/collide.py, core/idea_collide.py.

Spec 115 §5: a mark on the live product (`ideas.play_events`, `ideas.play_place`, `ideas.play_hints`, `ideas.play_mark`, `ideas.play_mark_offer`): gui/ideas_play_mark.py.

Spec 78: what the AI tools drew outside the code, its canvases (`ideas.canvases`, `ideas.canvas_seen`, `ideas.canvas_open`,
`ideas.canvas_file`; `canvases_new` and `canvases_rev` in the snapshot): gui/ideas_canvases.py.

Spec 37 §8: the Board's settings are the project's (`BoardHost.board_settings`: `<repo>/.orkcraft/board.json` over the
machine's `ideas`), read through `settings_now()` and written with `save_settings()`.
