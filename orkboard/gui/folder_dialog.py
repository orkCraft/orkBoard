"""Open folder's system dialog (the owner's notes of 19 October, 3): a project's folder chosen in the system's own
picker, not typed.

A page (in the app's window or a browser) gets no path from a picker of its own, so the host picks: pywebview's folder
dialog in the app's window (`attach` hands it the window, board_host.run), else the system's (`osascript`,
`zenity`/`kdialog`, PowerShell). A dialog runs on a thread of its own, so the socket never waits for it:
`folders.pick` gives a token, `folders.picked` what came of it. With no dialog on the machine the path is typed, as
before. For a project's folder; desktop only (a phone
never opens a dialog on the computer: gui/board_host.py `BoardPhone`).

    attach(window)                         # the app's window: its own folder dialog
    token = start("~/code")                # the dialog opened on a thread
    result(token)                          # {"state": "open" | "done" | "none" | "error", "path", "why"}
