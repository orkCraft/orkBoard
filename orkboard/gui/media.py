"""The files of a pick, served (docs/specs/51-pick-one.md §3): `GET /media/<goal>/<pick-id>/<file>?s=<signature>` on the page's server
(gui/server.py) and on the phones' listener (gui/phones.py). An `<img>`, an `<audio>` or a `<video>` loads it without a header, so
the address carries its proof: an HMAC of the path with a secret this process makes for its life. The host signs every `url` it
sends (`url()`, gui/ideas_pick.py), and nothing but what the paired faces were given can be fetched. No signature, a wrong one, a name
with `/` or `..`, a file the pick does not list, or a path of another pick: 404.

    media.url("dark-mode", "k1-r1", "b.png")     # "/media/dark-mode/k1-r1/b.png?s=3fa9…"
    reply = media.serve("GET", target, range_header, media.state_dirs(host))     # status, headers, a slice of the file
    reply.read()                                  # the bytes of the slice (the page's server); `write` streams them (the listener)

The file is the pick's own (realm/idea_pick.py): from its folder only, with the media type its `pick.json` stored, **Range** requests
(206, so a sound or a clip seeks), `Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable` (a round's files never change),
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox; default-src 'none'` with `Content-Disposition: inline`: an SVG
opened on its own runs nothing. The phone's service worker never caches `/media/` (pwa/sw.js).

An asset of the project (docs/specs/88-assets-and-play.md §1, §4) is `GET /media/_asset/<commit>/<path>?s=<signature>`, signed the
same way (`asset_url()`, gui/ideas_assets.py): the file as it is in that commit (dev's head, or the commit before), written once from
git into `<state>/assets-before/<commit>/<path>` and served from there, never from the working tree; with the media type of its
extension and the same headers (a commit's file never changes). A path with `..`, a hidden or skipped folder, an extension that is no
asset's, a secret's name (hooks/warder.py `is_secret`), or one the commit does not hold: 404, signed or not.
