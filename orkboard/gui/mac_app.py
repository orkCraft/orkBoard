"""Orkboard as a Mac app of its own (the owner's notes of 19 October, 1): `orkboard --make-app` puts Orkboard.app in
~/Applications, so it opens from the Dock, Launchpad and Spotlight as any app does, in its own window; and the window,
however it was started, is named Orkboard in the menu bar and the Dock, with its icon, not Python's.

The bundle is a launcher, not a copy: its one script starts the installed Orkboard (the Python it was made with) on
the last project, through the person's login shell and with the PATH it was made with, since an app opened from the
Dock gets neither (and without them no AI tool, git or brew is found), and where Claude Code and Codex keep their
sign-in when the terminal sets it (`KEPT`). Its output goes to ~/Library/Logs/Orkboard.log.
Made again after a reinstall moves Orkboard's Python; an update of Orkboard itself needs nothing.
