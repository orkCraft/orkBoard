"""Ideation's pitches (docs/specs/65-ideation.md §2, §5) as `gui/ideas.py`'s `Ideas` has them: a goal of a party the Investor leads
is a pitch, judged by the keeper (core/idea_judge.py) and never built. Split from ideas.py to keep it under ~600 lines.

    ideas.judge {slug}                      # judge it now: a new pitch put on Hold or Tonight, Try again after a failure
    ideas.pitch_send {slug, party, type?}   # Send to <party>: a new goal there, Now; the pitch is `sent`

    ideas.pitch_pass {slug, why?}           # Pass: kept with its why, read by every later pitch; the 201st oldest goes

A pitch is added with `ideas.add` in its party (one box, its lens, Now · Tonight · `hold`), dropped with `ideas.drop`. The plan's
commands refuse it in words (`refuse_pitch`). What the faces read of it is `pitch` on its page and on its Map node
(realm/pitches.py `face`).
