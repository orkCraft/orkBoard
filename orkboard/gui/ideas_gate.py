"""The gate (docs/specs/49-one-window.md §2.1) as `gui/ideas.py`'s `Ideas` has it: `ideas.gate`, what dev holds that main
lacks, and `ideas.gate_merge`, the one press that merges dev into main (realm/idea_gate.py). `dev` is the branch results
merge into (`ideas.into`), `main` the repository's default branch. Results still land in dev one by one; nothing reaches
main but through this press. Spec 50 §2.2: a goal raises its flag (realm/idea_flag.py) when this press takes it into main, or when it is done where there is
no gate. Split from ideas.py to keep it under ~600 lines.
