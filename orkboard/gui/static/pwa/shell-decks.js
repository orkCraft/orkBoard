// one phase: the front card, behind it one or two edges, and *×n* on its corner. A card says how far its goal is (*4 of 9 done*, spec 85 §4), wears the picture of what its task changed as its face (§3), and the stack of a task
// that merged turns over once as it leaves, to *What it made* (§4). A press on a stack of one opens it; a stack of more spreads (shell-spread.js). Only nodes are made here.
