// main lacks is `ideas.gate`'s: the goals with a merged task among those commits, with their parties, and the counts of commits and files; **Merge dev into main** is
// `ideas.gate_merge`. Nothing reaches main without the person. After the merge the screen says *main has every goal of dev* and the button is gone; the box of the merge's press is kept 10 s,
// where the flags the merge raised travel from (docs/specs/64-flags-raised.md §1.3).
