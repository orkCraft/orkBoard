// New party on the phone, on one sheet (docs/specs/41-phone-round-3.md §6, spec 50 §0, §6.7), top to bottom: what it is for — the description (focused) and the
// priority —, its craft — one row of six heads, the five crafts and Mixed, the picked one's word and line under it (decisions §53) —, its
// party folded to one line (Leads · Builds · Checks) with Change, its checks folded to one line, what is left of the AI tools, and Save party
// pinned at the foot. The team is three folds, one open at a time, each closed by Done: Leads (one seat: a pick folds it and opens Builds),
// Builds (three at most), Checks (two at most); the craft's party is in them at once. A task goes to the one of the party who does its kind of
// work (Grunt fills in); a checker's check adds its line to the spec's Done when and its task to the plan (realm/idea_checks.py). A Mixed
// goal starts with the Taskmaster alone, its craft its party's most. `makeParty` is the team and the checks alone: a goal's own screen
// changes its team with the same two (§7). Under the price, *It can take:* the goal types the seats would be offered (spec 63 §2); a party saved here gathers its heads into the party's deck (§4).
// With a host that proposes (spec 75 §5, shell-proposals.js) New party opens on the Orkmaster's proposals, and this sheet — the tiles, the seats, Save party — is **More: the library**, with the size switch added to it.
// Ideation (spec 65 §1) is the library's like any: its six agents are offered to no other party, and its seats are not changed (no Change; its price is a pitch's, it takes no goal type).
