// A release on the phone (docs/specs/68-release-and-route.md §3, §7.3, §7.6): New goal of *A release* asks **What goes in** — the goals that raised their flag in the parties the release's party releases
// from since its last release that is out (`ideas.release_candidates`), each a row with its element, its title, its party and its flag's date, ticked; one an open release holds is greyed with *In 1.4
// already* and cannot be ticked; none: *Nothing has raised its flag since 1.3.* and the goal can still be added. And **Releases from** in Edit the party and New party: the project's parties to tick,
// *Every party but Ideation* by default for the Release party. Orkboard submits nothing: the person says a release is out (shell-goals.js *Mark it out*).
