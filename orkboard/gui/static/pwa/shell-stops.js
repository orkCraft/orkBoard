// The hand first (docs/specs/67-hand-first.md §4): while a stop waits the zone is 250 px; the most urgent stop (or the one a tap brought forward) stands upright in front, 150 × 236, with its banner, its text and its quick answers (two at most, else the recommended
// one and *More…*) answered where it stands (`via: "front"`); the rest fan around it, 104 × 150, a card right of the front drawn mirrored; a tap on a fanned card brings it to the front, a tap on the front's body raises it. What follows is the hand as it was (spec 54):
// What waits for you, along the bottom (docs/specs/49-one-window.md §6, §10.6, §11; spec 54 §2–§4, decisions §67): **every stop of the project** (every party's plan, question, proposal, to-do, Pick one and
// failure, and Operations') and every party's results to look at, fanned across the whole width and centred, only their tops showing (56 px, no line over them; no count: the fan is
// the count). In the order of their urgency (shell-arena-words.js `byUrgency`: red, what holds work back, what does not, the results; the oldest first) laid out with the most urgent in the middle, the next to its
// right, the next to its left and so outward (`fanPlaces`): the cards stay in the page in the urgency's order, so the keys and a screen reader read it, and their place in the row is the CSS order. A stop of another
// party wears that party's leader's small head (Operations' its sliders) and says its party on its raised card and in its label; *Open…* and *Open it on its own screen* show that party first. Every stop has a way
// out that needs nothing from the person (shell-needs.js): a question *Let <asker> decide*, a to-do *Describe it instead*, *Go without it* or *Let <leader> choose*. The create button floats over the field, not here (shell-fab.js). A tap pops one out: it leaps from its place in the
// fan to a raised sheet above the scrim (in steps, none under reduced motion; its place in the fan stays empty while it is up) with its gem, its kind, its head, its
// title and text, its quick answers as 44 px buttons and *Open it on its own screen*. A tap on the scrim lays it back. The answers are the commands Needs you had:
// a plan starts, a plan change (the leader's new plan for the tasks not started, spec 62) is taken or kept, a question is answered by one of its choices, a proposal is taken or left, a failure starts again; a result is merged, sent back or dropped. Each wears its goal's element
// (spec 50 §6.8) and draws its marks with orkUI's signs. A plan that gives work to no one of the party says so on its card and its raised one (spec 52 §5.7): *No one in the party does pixel art:
// Artist would.*, with *Add and start* (the agent joins, then the work starts) when its seat is free, else *Edit the party*; *Start without* keeps today's way.
