// The Board on the phone (docs/specs/35-goals-window.md §11; 33-v1-shell.md §6; decisions §53, §62; spec 49 §10): the goal's window (shell-arena.js) with the
// pieces it opens — the goal's and the party's sheets, Operations, New idea, the cards at the top (While you were away, Last week) and the flags. A tap on a
// task, an idea or a stop opens it on its own full screen; every dialog is a sheet. A secret or a file is entered only over this paired link (29a).
