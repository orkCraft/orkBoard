// again: the newest `at` seen is kept per project (`localStorage` `orkboard.flags.goals.<project>`), written when the line first stands. A goal's row in
// the Flags fold is lit once. A device with no mark yet (the first start after this part) says nothing of the flags raised before.
// When the line stands, a raise waits (docs/specs/64-flags-raised.md): the new goals' elements travel from the gate to the line (partyline.js `FlagLine`), where the first
// six stay in a row; the box they travel from is the merge's press (gate.js keeps it for 10 s), else the gate's quiet line under the project's line (spec 90 §2.3).
