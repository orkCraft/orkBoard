// never move.
//   a task appears      the field did not have it a moment ago: it rises into its place from below, the side of the person (`.is-drawn`, ≤ 0.36 s)
//   the deal           a plan started by a press in the hand (spec 57): its new cards travel from the stop's box to their places instead of rising (`.is-dealt`,
//                       0.30 s in steps, 35 ms apart, six at most; the rest rise); one of the three moments that travel (decisions §76.3)
//   the gather         a new party saved (spec 63): its seats' heads travel as copies from their seats' boxes to the party's deck (`.arena-gather`, goaltabs.js, six at most,
//                       the deal's steps), the deck lit once after; none after Edit the party's save; one of the three
//   the flags raised    the first time the flag line stands for a gate's merge (spec 64, flags.js, partyline.js): its goals' elements (six at most) travel from the merge's press, else the gate's
//                       button, to its row (`.arena-flagfly`, the deal's steps: 0.30 s, 35 ms apart); then its flag steps up 6 px (0.18 s) and the line is lit once (0.6 s);
//                       one of the three
//   a task leaves       merged or dropped: its item fades where it stands with a one-frame ✓ (✗ for a drop), ≈ 0.3 s (`.is-leaving`); then its
//                       column settles: the queue behind it steps up toward the member into the gap (≈ 0.25 s, ease-out). The first three animate, the rest go.
//   a task moves        its state changed its place: it and the items it passes slide to their new places (FLIP: each item's old box measured
//                       before the redraw, its new one after, the difference played back, ≈ 0.25 s); nothing else moves
//   nothing moves under the pointer or the focus: while the pointer is over a column or the focus is inside it, its settle and moves wait
//                       (the gap stays empty) until the pointer leaves or the focus goes, at most 10 s
//   a stop leaves      answered or withdrawn, the stop in the hand fades where it stands (`useLeaving`, spec 58 §4), in the render its task changes; then the hand closes the gap
//   the seal           a result merged from Waits for your look (spec 74 §1): its goal's element, 28 x 28, stamped on the card (scale 2 → 1, 0.4 → 1 in three steps over the first third, `arena-stamp`),
//                       held while the card fades; the same FADE_MS. A dropped result keeps its ✗, one the filter took away no sign
//   back               a result sent back (§2): its task is in the field again; the card moves 24 px toward the field, the left, as it fades (`data-sign="back"`, 3 steps, FADE_MS), no sign
//   crumble            a collision's line on the project's level, answered or withdrawn while the page is seen (§3, project.js): kept 0.42 s more as `.is-leaving`, its stroke breaks into
//                       pixels and goes (3 steps, `arena-crumble`); not on the first read, none for a goal the filter hid, at once under reduced motion
//   the System's look  a Tech party's System tab opened (docs/specs/89-the-tech-lens-system.md §6.3, systemmap.js): what changed since the device's last look plays once — the map stands as it was
//                       (0.3 s), then each goal in the order it landed: its new parts dealt (`.sys-dealt`, 0.3 s in steps, 20 ms apart, six at most), its changed ones sealed with its element (`.sys-seal`,
//                       0.42 s), its gone ones crumble (`.sys-crumble`, 0.42 s, 3 steps); a goal 0.52 s after the one before, closer when there are many, so the whole is at most 3 s; a press (or a key)
//                       ends it, the parts as they are now. Only on the first answer the tab shows (none for a goal that lands while it is open), none under reduced motion or while the page is hidden
//   the quiet reward    a merge lights its member's first number and its column's ✓ k in dev once (≈ 0.6 s); nothing flies to them
//   a member struck     its head's sign turned ✗: the head is lit once and jolts 2 px sideways three times (`.is-struck`, ≈ 0.3 s, steps); turned !: the sign drops into its corner and the head hops 2 px
//                       (`.is-calling`, ≈ 0.25 s, steps). Not on the first read, not under the pointer or the focus, three heads at most in a refresh (decisions §80); nothing travels
