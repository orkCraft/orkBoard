// A goal's party from the Orkmaster (docs/specs/70-orkmaster-and-the-project.md §4): New goal on the project's level has no party at first. `usePartyFor` asks `ideas.party_for` (with the goal's type, again when the
// type changes) and holds the party picked — the one the Orkmaster suggests until the person picks another —; `ItsParty` is the field: a line *Orkmaster suggests <party>* with its fit (*takes it whole*,
// *needs <agent>*, *no one there does it*) and every party of the project as a chip to pick, each with its own fit. With no type the line is *Any party*, Ideation's chip last with *a pitch*.
// An older host (no `ideas.party_for`) gives the parties as the Map has them, the first suggested. Nothing is written and no model is called: the Orkmaster only says.
