// New party (docs/specs/50-parties-and-goals.md §3.7), one screen: its name, *What it is for* (one line), the party — *one of yours, or from the library*: the
// leader, builders and checkers in three bands of seats (ideas.roles `seats`, `parties`, realm/library.py), a click takes an agent in or out of its band,
// with what the party costs a goal (spec 43 §3) —, the checks on every goal and its priority (*goes first when the window is short*). No metrics, no deadline,
// no links: a party has no end. It sends `ideas.goal_save` with `title`, `about`, `team`, `every`, `leader`, `party` (a party of the person's that was picked), `preset` (the library's party the seats still are) and
// `priority`. A task goes to the one of the party who does its kind of work; a checker's check adds its line to a goal's Done when and its task to the plan
// (realm/idea_checks.py). The code's goal is a party. At the press of *Save party* the boxes of the seats' heads are kept: once the party is saved and shown, the heads gather into its deck
// (docs/specs/63-party-gathered.md §3, arena/goaltabs.js).
// With the Orkmaster's reading of the project (`ideas.map` `project.kind`, spec 75) New party opens on its proposals (proposals.js); *More: the library* opens this screen, with the party's size
// (Lean · Standard · Full, its Target) added. A host without the reading keeps this screen as it was.
