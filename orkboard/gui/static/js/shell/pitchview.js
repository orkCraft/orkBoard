// A pitch's screen (docs/specs/65-ideation.md §8, decisions §78), a goal of Ideation in the drawer — `ideas.page`'s `pitch` (realm/pitches.py `face`): the pitch
// (its Gist, what it points at); the four views side by side, each with its head, *For*, *Against* and its question (a view not answered yet waits, dim); the case
// against, the Skeptic's; the decision, the Investor's — its answer large, why, the kill reasons in their words, where and as what type, the first step, the
// cheapest test, the goal it repeats —; what became of it (sent, naming the goal; passed, with the person's line) and the decisions before. At its foot what the
// person does, saying what happens: **Send to <party>** with the party's select beside it (the decision's party first; a party of the library the project lacks
// opens New party with it), **Change and judge again** (the words, changed, judged anew), **Pass** (a line why, optional), **Drop**; **Try again** after a
// failure, **Judge again** for a passed one. A sent pitch says its goal's state under its decision (spec 68 §7.2: *Its goal · At work in Passkey · 3 of 7*, *In main*, *In Release 1.4*, *Out in 1.4*, *Dropped*), a press opening the goal. The pixel face is the headings' and the buttons'; the views' and the
// Investor's words are in the text face.
