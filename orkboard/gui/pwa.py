"""The town in a phone's browser: a web app the phone listener serves itself (docs/design/mobile.md §8.1, a
prototype). No app store and no build: the phone opens the tailnet's address, pairs, and adds the page to its
Home Screen. It speaks the protocol the phone listener speaks (gui/phones.py), with what a browser can say.

    GET /app/                     the app's files (gui/static/pwa/): its page, script, style, manifest, worker, icons
    GET /app/manifest.webmanifest?k=<device token>    the same manifest, its start_url carrying the token (iOS, below)
    /ws  Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: orkcraft.v1, bearer.<device token>   a browser cannot set Authorization

Only on the tailnet with its *.ts.net certificate (gui/tailnet.py) is this an app: a browser trusts that
certificate as it is, and a service worker or a Home Screen app needs one it trusts. On the LAN the listener's
certificate is self-signed and pinned (gui/phone_tls.py), which a browser cannot pin; the files are served
there too, for a person who accepts the warning on purpose, but the desktop offers no link to them.

Setting up: no QR code can join a phone to a tailnet (Tailscale's phone apps take no key from a link), so the
desktop leads the person through it (`phones.tailnet`): while no phone of theirs is in the tailnet its QR code
is Tailscale's download, with the account to log in as; once one is, it is the app's pairing link.

Pairing: the desktop shows a second QR code, `https://<name>.ts.net:<port>/app/#pair=<code>`. The code rides
in the fragment, which the browser never sends; the page trades it for a device token (`POST /api/pair`, as
any phone does) and keeps the token in the browser's storage. On iOS, Safari and the app added to the Home
Screen do not share storage: the page names the token in its manifest's start_url (`?k=`), so the app the
person adds opens with it once, keeps it, and wipes it from its address.

The files are only the app's shell: what the town is comes over the socket, after the token. They are the
same for everyone and say nothing of this town.
