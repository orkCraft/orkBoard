"""The spec after the start (docs/specs/62-spec-after-start.md): a goal's plan is passed and its work is under way, and its
spec changed. The person presses *Re-plan what is left*; the goal's leader looks at what is left and proposes a plan change: the
tasks not started changed, dropped or added, the tasks at work and the merged ones left as they are. It is saved beside the plan
(realm/idea_change.py) and comes to the hand as one stop; the runner applies it when the person takes it
(core/idea_review.py `revise_tasks`). A mixin of `IdeaKeeper`, as `idea_draft.py` is.

    keeper.revise(slug)               # in the background: refused in words, then `revise_one`
    keeper.revise_one(slug)           # the same, on this thread: one call on the `plan` step, one shot, read-only
    keeper.revise_prompt(root, slug)  # the spec, what changed, what is done, at work and not started
    clean_change(plan, answer)        # the leader's answer, strictly: only what can still change

Nothing is applied here and no task is touched: the keeper never writes a passed plan (`ideas.save_plan` refuses it). `self` has
the keeper's `ask`, `parse`, `wiki_root`, `state_dir`, `_start`, `_may_run`, `busy`, `refuse_spent`, `publish`, `_ev`, `measure`,
`reads`, `target`, `role_of`, `team_lines`, `team_checks`, `idea_checks`.

  dropped, by its id; a task you name in neither `change` nor `drop` stays as it is. A task marked "check" stays too: it waits
  for every other task, the new ones included.
- Change a task only when the spec's change reaches it: give its whole new brief, not a patch. Drop one only when the spec no
  longer needs it. Add a task only for work the spec now needs that no task covers (at most {kw.MAX_TASKS}); each is a brief another
  Claude session can do alone, in a worktree of the repository: what to change, where, and how it is tested.
- Each task's tag (`kind`), the kind of work it is, one of: {kinds}. Ordinary work is "code".{team}
- Each task's tier, its complexity: "elder" (hard design or a wide change), "warrior" (ordinary code), "laborer" (small, mechanical).
- `after`: the ids of the tasks a task needs the result of (any task above but a check, or an added task by its `key`); none that
  makes two tasks wait for each other.
- If nothing needs to change, answer with empty lists.
