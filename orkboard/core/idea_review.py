"""What the person does at Review (docs/specs/33-v1-shell.md §3), and each task's log: the runner's second half.

    ReviewMixin on `IdeaRunner` (core/idea_runner.py): merge / back / drop_task / skip_task / revise_tasks / stop_task / log.

A result waits at `review` holding its worktree and branch. **Merge** lands it into `ideas.merge_into` (only when its
tests are green and it does not conflict); **Send back** resumes the task's session with one line; **Drop** fails it
("dropped by you") and keeps its branch. The log is each task's session output, shown and never fed back to a model;
a secret's value never appears in it. Split from the runner to keep both under ~600 lines.
