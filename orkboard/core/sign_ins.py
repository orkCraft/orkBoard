"""Sign-ins (docs/specs/45-sign-in.md §4): the host's service that keeps, for each AI tool, whether it needs its own
sign-in, starts it, and tells the work that waits for it when it is done. No face: every change is published on the bus.

    signins = SignIns(bus, env, state_dir)       # watches `tool_errors`: a login failure that a sign-in helps begins an episode
    signins.start("claude", auto=True)           # the tool's own sign-in, one run per tool (realm/sign_in.py)
    signins.cancel("claude") / signins.done("pi") / signins.stop_all()
    signins.blocked("claude")                    # the tool needs its sign-in: what runs by itself waits (spec 45 §6)
    signins.holds(err)                           # a failure that a sign-in helps: the work is held for it
    signins.snapshot()                           # the snapshot's `sign_in`: the tools not done, in the registry's order
    signins.tick()                               # the host's clock: its open runs are polled (at most every POLL_S)

An **episode** begins with a failure that a sign-in helps while the tool has none going, and ends at `done` (by its run, by
a run of the tool that ended well, or because the tool says it is signed in: `by` `browser` | `terminal` | `elsewhere`).
`auto` is true from its start until the first `start(auto=True)`: a second page, a reload or a second failure open nothing
more by themselves. Each change publishes `bus.SIGN_IN`; `done` also `bus.SIGNED_IN`. Never a toast or a dialog.
