"""A party's leader (decisions §53; realm/goal_team.py): a party's steps run as the leader of its party — its reading, its
goals' drafts, answers, talk and plans — on the leader's model, the leader's voice and instruction before the step's own
prompt; the Taskmaster when the party has no leader picked (and for what is no party's: the night's proposals). Nothing accepts
a party by itself any more (spec 50 §2.2); `accept_goal` stays for the person to ask of a party with metrics written before
(`ideas.goal_accept`: its verdict, realm/goal_verdict.py, is kept as history).

    keeper.leader()                  # the role the running step leads as, None for the Taskmaster
    keeper.accept_goal("ship")       # asked by the person, in the background, as the party's run (`goal:<slug>`)

A mixin of `IdeaKeeper`; `self` has its `ask`, `parse`, `wiki_root`, `state_dir`, `_start`, `_tls`, `publish`, `_ev`.
