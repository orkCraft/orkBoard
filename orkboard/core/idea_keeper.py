"""The board's keeper (spec 29a §4, decisions §43, §47; docs/specs/35-goals-window.md): it reads goals, drafts each
idea straight into its spec, talks a spec through with the person, turns a spec into a plan, and works at night.

    keeper = IdeaKeeper(repo_root, state_dir, wiki_root=lambda: root, settings=lambda: machine.ideas,
                        publish=lambda slug: ..., limits=lambda: town.limits, on_plan=autostart)
    keeper.draft(slug)                # an idea → its spec (core/idea_draft.py), then its plan when it asks nothing
    keeper.answer(slug, ["…", "…"])   # the person answers the spec's questions at once: the rest is written, then the plan
    keeper.say(slug, "Why not a toggle?", "Risks")    # an edit of one section, in the background
    keeper.plan(slug)                 # Re-plan: the page → plan.json, with its estimate
    keeper.revise(slug)               # Re-plan what is left, after the start: a plan change for the tasks not started (core/idea_revise.py)
    keeper.judge(slug)                # a pitch (a goal of Ideation): its four views, the case against, the Investor's decision (core/idea_judge.py)
    keeper.read_stop(slug)            # this idea's run stops (its own cancel); its queue is `hold`
    keeper.tick()                     # the host's clock: what the limits held runs again, and the night (core/idea_night.py)

- **The Target** (realm/idea_target.py) picks each step's tier and effort: goal, draft, talk, plan, refresh, propose. The
  Taskmaster's own model, when it is not its default `elder`, replaces the tier; the Target still gives the effort.
- **Goal** (read-only, core/idea_goals.py): a goal saved is read at once: its title, Summary, Metrics, links, questions.
- **Draft** and **answer** (read-only, core/idea_draft.py): an idea straight to its spec; its questions answered at once.
- **One call, one job** (spec 35 §0): every call is a fresh `claude -p` (never `--resume`, no session kept), given only
  what its step needs, cut to `idea_target.CONTEXT`, with its budget (`--max-budget-usd`). The page is the memory; the
  talk is archived in `talk.jsonl` and never read back into a model. One round of questions: the `answer` call asks
  nothing more. Each call is measured (`step`, `prompt_chars`, `tokens`, `cost`) on the keeper's events, and its line
  goes to the ledger (realm/idea_spend.py, spec 36 §1).
- **Plan**: the page → `plan.json` (at most 8 tasks), its Stages and its risk written by code, the estimate from the
  tiers the tasks will run on, at what the board's last tasks on each cost (spec 36 §6); then `on_plan(slug)` (the face decides whether it starts by itself, spec 35 §5).
- **The window** (spec 35 §6): in a spent window a call is not made; what runs by itself waits with `held_until`, a
  call the person asks for is refused in plain words.

Every model call goes through `realm/jobs.py` on the `claude` harness; its answer is untrusted: it is parsed
strictly and only known sections are written. Each change is published (`publish(slug)`: the face puts
`ideas.changed` on the bus). The keeper never commits: the pages stay in the working tree. No face.

Rules:
- At most {MAX_TASKS} tasks. Each is a brief another Claude session can do alone, in a worktree of the repository:
  what to change, where, and how it is tested; it names the Done when lines it proves. `after` only where a task
  needs another's result.
- Each task's tag (`kind`), the kind of work it is, one of: {kinds}. Ordinary work is "code".{team}
- A task may end with two to six variants of one kind for the person to pick from instead of a change, only when the spec asks to
  choose by eye or by ear (a logo, an icon, a sound, a clip, a name or a tagline): give it `"pick": {{"n": 2 to 6, "kind": "image" |
  "audio" | "video" | "text", "ask": "<the question, one line>", "target": "<the repository path the picked one is written to>"}}`. At
  most one such task per goal at a time; never for code.
- Each task's tier, its complexity: "elder" (hard design or a wide change), "warrior" (ordinary code), "laborer"
  (small, mechanical).
- To-dos only for what a task cannot start without: a key ("secret": its title is the environment variable's name,
  e.g. API_KEY), a decision ("choice", with its choices), a yes ("confirm"), steps a person does ("instructions"), a
  file the person gives ("file": its title says what the file is, e.g. the Firebase config, google-services.json;
  `accept` the extensions it may have). Any kind may carry `steps` when the person has to do something first. Most
  plans need none. `for`: the tasks that wait for it.
