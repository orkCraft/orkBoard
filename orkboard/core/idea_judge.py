"""A pitch judged (docs/specs/65-ideation.md §3, §7): its four views, each alone, then the case against, then the Investor's decision;
three read-only steps, each call one shot and measured, each as its role (`ask(..., as_role=)`: the role's voice and instruction
first, its own model when the person set one on Agents). A mixin of `IdeaKeeper`, as `idea_draft.py` is.

    keeper.judge(slug)              # in the background, as the pitch's run: raw, failed, judged or passed → judging → judged
    keeper.judge_one(slug)          # the same, on this thread (the night's way)
    keeper.is_pitch(slug)           # its party is led by the Investor: it is judged, never drafted or planned

- **The views** (`pitch_view`), one call per view, at most two at once, each alone: no view's prompt holds another's answer. The
  Engineering view may read the repository with the draft's read-only tools; the others get none. A view that fails is tried once
  more; a second failure fails the pitch (*Market view did not answer: try again*). Each view is kept as it answers, so the faces
  light its head.
- **The case against** (`pitch_case`), as the Skeptic: the pitch and the four views (tried once more, as a view).
- **The decision** (`pitch_decide`), as the Investor: the pitch, the views, the case, the project's parties with the goal types each
  is offered and the library's parties not in the project, the goals done and in work and the pitches passed. Its answer is cut and
  cleaned by realm/pitches.py; the page's Decision section is written from it.

Stop all, or the person's stop, fails it with *stopped* (Try again). `self` has the keeper's `ask`, `wiki_root`, `state_dir`,
`_start`, `_tls`, `_may_run`, `hold`, `refuse_spent`, `busy`, `publish`, `_ev`, `measure`, `target`.
