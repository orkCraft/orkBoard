"""The keeper's reading of a goal (spec 34 §1, spec 35 §2): a goal saved is sent to the keeper at once, read-only, on
the Target's `goal` step — it writes the title (unless the person typed one), the Summary every idea under the goal
starts from, at most 8 links that exist, and 0–3 questions; `read_at` is the commit it read (the night's refresh,
core/idea_night.py). It asks no metrics (spec 50 §2.5: a party has no end) and reads none from the answer; the metrics a
goal has from before stay on its page and are passed on as written. Split from `idea_keeper.py` (the module's size).

    keeper.read_goal(slug, "answer")   # the person answers its questions: the talk of an idea's, on a goal

A mixin of `IdeaKeeper`; `self` has its `ask`, `wiki_root`, `state_dir`, `_start`, `_busy`, `_may_run`, `publish`.
