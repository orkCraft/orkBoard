"""The Board's night (docs/specs/35-goals-window.md §7, §8): once a night, at the start of `ideas.night` (the machine's
local time), and again inside it when the reserve held it. A mixin of `IdeaKeeper`.

    keeper.night_tick(now)           # from the keeper's clock: the night when it is due, in a thread
    keeper.run_night()               # the same, on this thread: its counts (the `night_run` event)

In this order, each step stopping at the reserve (realm/idea_target.py `reserve_held`):
  1. the `night` queue: draft → plan → autostart, by priority, then the person's order; when the Claude week is behind its
     pace (spec 44), the Board's own Low ideas stay queued (`paced` in `night_run`) and the person's are drafted; a pitch
     put off to the night is judged first, held only by the spent window (it is the person's own: spec 65 §7), and counted
     in `drafted`;
  2. the plans that start at night (`start_night(slug)`: the face hands them to the runner);
  3. refresh (balance, quality): a goal whose linked paths, or the paths its Summary names, changed since its `read_at`
     is read again on the `refresh` step; an unchanged goal costs nothing;
  4. proposals (balance 2, quality 3, thrift none): new ideas in the state `proposed`, never more than 3 waiting, a
     declined one read back from `<state_dir>/ideas/declined.jsonl`;
  5. a party's proposal (spec 43 §4.2): a checker that found nothing in the last eight check tasks of a goal is proposed
     to leave its party. Code decides, no model is called, so it is not limited by the Target's proposals nor counted
     among the three waiting.

All of it runs only with `night_low` (spec 83 §5, decisions §100): the person's one standing permission, asked once.

The camp's Night round (docs/design/night-round.md) is another thing and is not touched here.
