"""Operations' runner (docs/specs/38-operations.md §1, §3–§7): an operation added from a template is prepared by one
call, checked by the person, and done by one more call allowed only the one tool that does it.

    runner = OpRunner(op_runs.root(), settings=lambda: machine.ops, limits=lambda: host.limits(),
                      publish=lambda op="", template="": ...)
    runner.start()                         # what the host lost when it closed: a prepare again, an action failed
    op_id = runner.add("jira-task", {"what": "…"}, device="desktop")
    runner.act(op_id, fields, draft)       # the check passed, as corrected
    runner.tick()                          # the host's clock: what the limits held runs again; the old texts go
    runner.stop_all()                      # Stop all: every operation's call is cancelled

- **One job per call** (§4): `op_prepare` reads with its template's tools and changes nothing; `op_act` is allowed
  only the action's tool, and code reads its events to tell what it did; `op_learn` has no tools. Each is a fresh
  `claude -p` in `ops/work/`, its tier, effort and budget from Operations' Target (realm/idea_target.py), its prompt
  and output kept under `ops/calls/` only, its telemetry line in `ops/ledger.jsonl` (`call_log.apart`, on its own
  thread: a project's call made meanwhile stays the project's), its ledger line in `ops/spend.jsonl`.
- **Nothing is done twice by Orkboard** (§3): an action that may have run (`acted` true or null) is never tried again.
- **By itself** (§6): a clean check sends the template by itself; a correction, Not right, a new version or Check
  again sends it back; a doubt, a `high` risk or the day's cap stop it at the check (realm/op_runs.py).
- **The limits** (§1): in a spent window (`status.NEARLY`) a call is not made, the operation waits with
  `held_until`; the person's own operations keep no reserve. **The person's cap**: while the day's spend across the
  open projects and Operations reached the smallest of their caps (core/treasury.py `persons_cap`), no call is made
  either: the operation waits (*waits: the day's spend cap is reached*) and the person's press is refused.
- **A learn call held** by a spent window or the cap waits in `ops/templates/<name>/learn.json` and runs after a
  restart too.
- At most MAX_PARALLEL calls at once; the rest wait in order. No face: what changed is published.
- **A brief** (docs/specs/66-team-briefs.md): its prepare writes a page and it stops at the check (**Keep**) or, by
  itself, is kept; it has no action. About people, its prompts carry `PEOPLE_RULE` and its bound reads are checked
  against the prepare's calls; a follow brief starts from the last one kept of the same value; standing briefs are
  added on the tick and keep the reserve (core/op_briefs.py).

The person's commands (add, the check's action, Prepare again, Stop, Drop, …) are core/op_commands.py's; a brief's
Keep, Forget and standing briefs core/op_briefs.py's.
