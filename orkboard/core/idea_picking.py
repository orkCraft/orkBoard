"""The runner's part of Pick one (docs/specs/51-pick-one.md §2.2, §2.3): a task that makes variants ends by waiting for the person,
and the person's answer carries it on. `PickMixin` is on `IdeaRunner` (core/idea_runner.py, which imports this one).

    runner.pick(slug, tid, "B", "a bit darker", device="phone", via="hand")   # the variant B is committed at the plan's target
    runner.pick(slug, tid, None, "rounder, please")                           # none of them: the task runs again as its next round

After its session a task that makes variants leaves its files and manifest in the worktree (realm/idea_pick.py `read`). They move to
the goal's state folder and the task is `picking`: it holds its worktree and branch, spends nothing and waits (Stop all leaves it
be; Drop ends it). **A key**: the picked file is written to `target` in the task's worktree and committed alone (*<task>: B · <name>*),
and the task goes on as any task with a change does (the gate, then Review or the merge as the project says), the note told to the tasks
that wait for it. **None**: a note is required; the task runs again as the next round and the last round's variants stay as history.
