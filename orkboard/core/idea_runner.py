"""The runner of a passed plan (docs/specs/29a-board-focus.md §5, 33 §2–§3): each task its own Claude session in a
worktree, tested, then judged at Review by the person, who merges it into `ideas.merge_into` (default `dev`; rebased
and fast-forwarded, pushed only when `ideas.push`), sends it back with a line, or drops it.

    runner = IdeaRunner(repo_root, state_dir, settings, bus)
    runner.start(slug)        # after `ideas.start` set the plan's `passed_at`
    runner.tick()             # every few seconds from the host: never blocks, the work runs on threads
    runner.stop(slug) / runner.stop_all()
    runner.merge(slug, tid) / runner.back(slug, tid, why) / runner.drop_task(slug, tid) / runner.stop_task(slug, tid)
    runner.log(slug, tid)     # the task's session output, last 200 lines (kept in <state_dir>/ideas/<slug>/<tid>.log)

The plan's tasks live in `<state_dir>/ideas/<slug>/plan.json` (the runner owns them once the plan is passed; it
re-reads the file before each write, so the keeper's to-dos stay as the keeper wrote them). A task waits for its
`after` tasks to be merged and for the to-dos `for` it to be done, starts when a slot is free (`ideas.max_parallel`)
and its tool's window is not nearly spent (else `held`, "after HH:MM"), works as its task type's role (that role's
model and instruction; its `max_parallel` is held besides `ideas.max_parallel`, spec 34 §3), passes the gate (once more on the
same session when red) and waits at `review`, green or red, holding its worktree and branch (`ideas.review` false:
green lands by itself, as before; a result for which no test ran waits at `review` all the same). Every task change publishes `ideas.changed`. All git: realm/idea_git.py.

Spec 35: a task runs on the Target's tier and effort (`ran_tier`, `effort`; a role's own model wins); `start_at: "night"`
starts only inside the night window; `passed_by: "auto"` leaves the person the reserve (realm/idea_target.py `gate`);
ideas go by `rank` (priority, then order); a file to-do's path reaches its task in the environment (idea_secrets).
