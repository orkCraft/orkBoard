# Updates

Orkboard looks for a newer version of itself and installs it with orkGet's updater, which it carries as a copy
(`orkboard/orkget/`, [orkGet's docs/updates.md](https://github.com/orkWorks/orkGet/blob/main/docs/updates.md)):
the same code as Orkline's, with Orkboard's profile (`orkboard/product.py`).

## What a person sees

- **In the window**: when a newer version is out, Orkboard asks once per version, in a dialog with **Update and
  restart** (`js/shell/update.js`). A **critical** update (a fix for something that loses work or lets harm in) is
  asked loudly; a **major** one (a later line: 0.1 → 0.2, 1.x → 2.0, or a release marked `"major": true`) says that
  what is new may change how you work. *Later* hides it until the next version (a critical one, until the window
  opens again).
- **Settings → Updates**: the version, what is out with *Update…*, *Check now*, and which updates install by
  themselves when Orkboard opens: *Critical ones* (the default), *All*, or *None*.
- **On a paired phone** (the same page in the phone's frame, its crown's menu: `js/hand/upphone.js`): **Update and
  restart** installs a newer version on the computer. The computer restarts on it: what ran is cut off, and the tasks
  cut off start again by themselves. The phone shows *The board went away: trying again…*, comes back by itself in a
  few seconds and says *Updated: the computer runs Orkline X*. The menu's *Check for updates* asks the computer to read
  the list again. Which updates install by themselves stays the computer's to say. For this the computer stays on
  and awake, Orkboard running, and Tailscale on on both.
- **The terminal**: `orkboard update` installs what is out, `orkboard update check` only says it,
  `orkboard update auto|critical|ask` sets what installs by itself. One setting per machine, shared with Orkline.

A critical update installs when Orkboard opens, before anything else loads, unless the setting is *None*; an install
that fails never stops Orkboard from opening and is tried again after a day.

## Releasing

One commit to `main` raises `__version__` in `orkboard/__init__.py` and adds the release at the top of
[`updates.json`](../updates.json) (`tests/test_updates.py` checks both). `"critical": true` only for a security fix or
a bug that loses work: it installs on every machine without asking, and its `notes` say plainly what it fixes.
`"major": true` only for a release that changes what people do when its number does not say so already.

Installed copies read the list from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orkWorks/orkBoard/main/updates.json` (`PRODUCT.manifest`, pinned by the tests):
that address never changes, and it has to be readable without signing in, or no copy ever sees an update.

`ORKCRAFT_NO_UPDATE=1` (and CI) turns updates off; `ORKCRAFT_UPDATE_URL` reads the list from elsewhere (a fork, a
`file://` path).
