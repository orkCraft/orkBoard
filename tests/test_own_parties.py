"""Spec 43 F (docs/specs/43-party-measured.md §6, Tests → F): your parties — the file (save, the twelve, a taken name refused and replaced, drop,
`uses` at most 50, a broken file read as none and kept, mode 600), `ideas.party_save` from a goal with an agent of the person's own,
`ideas.goal_save` with `party` in another project, a later party change clearing it, accepting the goal marking `met`, `ideas.parties`, the
events. Code, no model."""
