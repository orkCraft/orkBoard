"""The lens a new idea is written with (decisions §53; realm/idea_lens.py, realm/code_map.py): the goal's party offers its
crafts' lenses, its leader's open first; what the person points at — parts of the repository, a screen with areas marked,
a segment and its pain — is kept with the idea and given to the keeper with its text."""
