"""The whole loop of the board in focus (docs/specs/29a-board-focus.md, 33 §2–§4, 35 §2–§5): a goal from a description,
an idea under it drafted at once, its question answered (one round), the plan made at once and started by itself (low risk, Normal),
its task a Claude session whose commit waits at Review; the person merges it into `dev`, which is made, and nothing is
pushed. A real Orkboard host on a temp repository with a bare origin; `claude` is a stub on PATH that answers each kind of call."""
